# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Watcher

A full-stack web application for real-time stock price tracking.

**Live Demo**: **[https://stock-watcher-portfolio.vercel.app](https://www.google.com/search?q=)**

## Overview

Stock Watcher is a portfolio-ready web application designed to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of modern full-stack development. It allows users to create an account, build a personalized watchlist of stock symbols, and monitor their prices with data fetched live from the Finnhub financial API.

This project was built from the ground up, starting with a robust Django REST backend and a dynamic React frontend, all connected to a PostgreSQL database. It showcases best practices such as secure token-based authentication, environment variable management, and a clean, component-based frontend architecture.

## Features

  * **Secure User Authentication**:

      * Users can register for a new account and log in securely.
      * The backend uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management, ensuring that user data is protected.

  * **Personalized Stock Dashboard**:

      * Once logged in, users are presented with a personal dashboard.
      * Users can perform full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their watchlist.
      * The interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive.

  * **Real-Time Price Data**:

      * Leverages the **Finnhub API** to fetch live market data for all stocks in a user's watchlist.
      * Prices are displayed alongside the stock symbols for easy viewing.

  * **Automatic 1-Minute Refresh**:

      * The dashboard automatically polls for new price data every 60 seconds, ensuring users always have up-to-date information without needing to refresh the page.
